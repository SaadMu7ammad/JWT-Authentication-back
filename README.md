# JWT-Authentication

## an application on jwt from scratch to apply what i've learned 

create a simple login/register website that used to store your tasks 

first you must register with email after that will recieve a hello email and emails are unique

then will redirect you to the login page 

also if you forgot your password you can reset it via email

there is 2 sections one for you tasks and another for all people registered on the website 

there is live updating means that if a user delete or edit his task will be deleted/edited also on All page tasks directly

for the another users
no one can edit or delete others tasks
only your tasks !
